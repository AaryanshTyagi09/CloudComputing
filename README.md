🔍 Always digging into data to uncover the cool stuff machines can learn.  
⚙️ I live in a world of Python, where `pandas` are friendly, `sklearn` is my toolkit, and `PySpark` brings the firepower.  

💡 I believe coffee + good code = great models.  
🎯 Currently exploring the infinite world of AI, one dataset at a time.
